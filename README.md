# Sign-Language-Translator-
#An LSTM-mediapipe deep learning  model used to perform sign language translation

Problem Statement
<ul>
<li>The only way the speech and hearing impaired (i.e dumb and deaf) people can communicate is by sign language. The main problem of this way of communication is normal people who cannot understand sign language canâ€™t communicate with these people or vice versa.
</li>
<li>Our project aims to bridge the gap between the speech and hearing impaired people and the normal people. The basic idea of this project is to make a system using which dumb people can significantly communicate with all other people with the help of gestures. The system does not require the background to be perfectly black. It works on any background. 
</li>
<li>The project uses image processing system to identify, especially English alphabetic sign language used by the deaf people to communicate and converts them into text</li>
</ul>
